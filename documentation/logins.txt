There are several ways to implement logins for Mamook[tm]:
1. NIS/YP tables
2. Querying a separate database
3. Storing encrypted passwords within the Mamook database
4. Setting constants for loginIDs (this is only recommended in a test environment)

misc/authenticate.inc is the file where logins are determined. Student and Office (staff) access 
levels are set to use login methods 1, 2, and 4.  Employer access is set up for login method 3.

If any of the methods are not to be used for your organization, you should comment out the relevant code.

1.  NIS/YP tables

NIS is enabled for logins by changing the $validators and $group_validators variables in authenticate.inc.
The domain, map, and node need to be set to match your NIS configuration.  this->group_departments needs to 
be set with the group, userlevel, and department of each defined NIS group.

----------
Example set-up:

    var $validators = Array(
            Array("domain"=>"nis.your_nisdomain.ca", "map"=>"passwd.byname")
            );

    var $group_validators = Array(
            Array("domain"=>"nis.your_nisdomain.ca", "map"=>"netgroup.byuser", "node"=>".*")
            );
            
    $this->group_departments = Array(
            Array("group"=>"staff",
                "userlevel"=>OFFICE,
                "department"=>$departments["ENGR"]),
            Array("group"=>"managers",
                "userlevel"=>OFFICE,
                "department"=>$departments["ENGR"]),
            Array("group"=>"class2002",
                "userlevel"=>STUDENT,
                "department"=>$departments["ENGR"])
            );
----------


2. Querying a separate database

A database reference system can be used for authentication if you do not have NIS.  You can 
write a perl script to query a separate database with the provided login and password 
and return the required information.  You should return an integer indicating if the 
query was successful or not (return 1 if successful), a letter indicating the type 
of user (eg. S for student, A for admin), and an integer specific to that individual 
(student number for students, employee_number for admin/staff).

Note that this method could also be used to query the Mamook database instead of a 
separate one.


3. Storing encrypted passwords within the Mamook database

Employer passwords are stored directly in the Mamook database in encrypted format.  You 
cannot unencrypt the passwords, but you can use the same salt to encrypt the password that the 
employer enters and then compare the two encrypted values.  The salt consists of the first two 
characters in the encrypted password.


4. Setting constants for loginIDs (this is only recommended in a test environment)

There are two login constants defined in release_constants.inc:
ADMIN_LOGIN and STUDENT_LOGIN
These constants are set up to allow you to log in as either an administrator (Office 
userlevel) or as a student with a pre-defined login ID and no password.  This should 
ALWAYS be turned off in a production environment because it is a big security hole. 
These logins can be used for testing purposes and for demo/training database setups 
where you do not require everyone to have their own account.  These logins are enabled 
and disabled in misc/release_constants.inc.  Note that the department 
for these logins is set directly in authenticate.inc.
