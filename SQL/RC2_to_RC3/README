| Description: This file provides instructions for updating the database       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

IMPORTANT NOTE: This only applies when updating from version Mamook-2.0RC2 to 
Mamook-2.0RC3.  If you downloaded Mamook-2.0RC3 or later, the changes have 
already been applied.

The changes from version Mamook-2.0RC2 to Mamook-2.0RC3 require updates to the 
database.  The changes involve adding a menu for the feedback system for the 
STUDENT, OFFICE, and TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR userlevels.  This also requires a database 
change to enable the feedback module.  If you have altered the default modules 
that were in the original mamook.sql file, you should look at the RC2_to_RC3.sql 
file to ensure that the module insert statement still applies.  If you have not 
made changes to the 'module' table, you should be able to apply the sql file 
to the database without needing to make any changes.

Other changes include removing an obsolete table, 'reset_when', and removing 
superfluous indexes.

To apply the changes to the database (assuming your database is "MAMOOK"):
mysql -u username -p MAMOOK < RC2_to_RC3.sql
